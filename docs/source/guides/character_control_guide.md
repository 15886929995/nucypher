# NuCypher Character Control Guide

The _Character Control_ is a module that contains useful REST-like HTTP endpoints for working with NuCypher characters.
Character control is currently a Work-In-Progress. Expect large, and even breaking, changes to this API often.

**Warning: Character control is currently not intended for use over remote connections or on shared machines.
The current API has not been secured and should not be used for production applications.**
